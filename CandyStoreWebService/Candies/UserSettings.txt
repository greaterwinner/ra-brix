The UserSettings Module is really crucial in that it's your only interface to changing any USER-settings of your portal. It will give you a visual grid-like interface from where you can edit existing user-settings from. This module is not as important as the "Settings" module, since most settings are global and not on a user level, but for highly complex and rich portals it might prove invaluable.
